README

- This project is a basic javascript game made to showcase what I've
	recently learned with javascript to possible employers. It features
	three tabs, a Story, Instructions and a Game tab. The game has only
	one 'level' so far, and a congratulations screen. To win the game,
	you must get to the top of the screen.
	
- To open the project, make sure you have all the files locally and 
	execute "project.html" in the web browser of your choice.
	(Double clicking on the file usually works)
	
- Files you need for it to run:
	- Tabs.js
	- Game.js
	- style.css
	- The image and sound contents in the assests folder

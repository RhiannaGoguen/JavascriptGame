What do we want to do with this project?

I want to have some sort of navigation to different pages
Maybe a game? One page could be a welcome, one could be instructions and one could be the crappy game.
Basic text adventure? With fun images? Not sure how that would go, too many images... to many pages,
I think I might need a DB for something that complex and I'm not in the mood for that.

So... we want something not too complex. 
Navigation onto three(?) pages. 
	- Instructions
	- Welcome
	- Content
	
But... what do we want our content to be? 
		- Some sort of crappy game would be cool
		- Maybe a text adventure?
